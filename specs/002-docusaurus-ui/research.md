# Research & Decisions for Docusaurus UI Update

This document records the key architectural and content strategy decisions for the Docusaurus UI update.

## 1. Theming and Styling

- **Decision**: Use Docusaurus's built-in theming capabilities by modifying `src/css/custom.css`. We will use CSS variables to define the color palette and other theme properties.
- **Rationale**: This is the standard way to customize the look and feel of a Docusaurus site. It allows for easy and centralized control over the UI.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
    - **Swizzling**: Swizzling Docusaurus components would give us more control, but it's more complex and can lead to maintenance issues when upgrading Docusaurus. We will only swizzle components if absolutely necessary.

## 2. Font

- **Decision**: Use the "Inter" font from Google Fonts. We will import it in the `src/css/custom.css` file.
- **Rationale**: "Inter" is a modern, highly readable sans-serif font that is well-suited for a documentation website.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
    - **System fonts**: Using system fonts would be faster, but would not provide a consistent look and feel across different operating systems.

## 3. Navbar and Sidebar

- **Decision**: The sticky navbar with a blur effect will be implemented using custom CSS. The collapsible sidebar is a built-in Docusaurus feature that we will style with custom CSS.
- **Rationale**: This approach leverages Docusaurus's built-in features while allowing for a high degree of customization.

## 4. Custom Sidebar Titles

- **Decision**: The custom sidebar titles (e.g., "Chapter 01: ...", "Part 1: ...") will be implemented by modifying the `sidebars.ts` file to use explicit category and doc link labels.
- **Rationale**: Docusaurus sidebars are highly configurable and allow for custom labels for each item. This is the most direct way to achieve the desired result.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
    - **Autogenerated sidebars**: Autogenerated sidebars are easier to set up, but they don't allow for custom titles.
